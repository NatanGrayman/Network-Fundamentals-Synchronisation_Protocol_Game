# Network Fundamentals Project: Multiplayer Math Game using TCP/IP Synchronization Protocol

## Introduction
This project, undertaken as part of the ELEN4017A: Network Fundamentals course at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, illustrates the design and implementation of a synchronization protocol for an online multiplayer reaction game. The project achieved a distinction. 

## Project Description
The project aims to design a robust synchronization protocol using socket programming to enable synchronized gameplay for multiple users in a networked environment. A simple mathematics game was implemented to demonstrate the protocolâ€™s functionality. The project focuses on latency checking, delay propagation, and response time capturing to ensure fair and synchronized gameplay.

## Key Features
- **Synchronization Protocol**: A custom synchronization protocol ensuring all users receive the game challenges simultaneously.
- **Multithreading**: Utilized to handle multiple client connections efficiently.
- **Latency Check and Delay Propagation**: Dynamically calculated and applied to ensure fair play.
- **Login System**: Secure username and password authentication, with passwords 'stored' with hashes.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and timeout functionalities on both server and client sides.
- **Score Calculation**: Dynamic calculation and update of players' scores based on response accuracy and speed.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, OS
- **Tools**: Wireshark for packet capturing, 

## Results
The synchronization protocol was successfully implemented and tested, ensuring fair and synchronized gameplay across different network conditions. The project achieved a distinction, demonstrating the effective application of network TCP/IP Knowledge , programming and synchronization techniques.
